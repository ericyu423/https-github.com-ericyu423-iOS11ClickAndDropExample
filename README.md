* new xcode can create a new folder in github with user name and password

click on the icon next to the folder icon

under remote folder right click on it one of the selection is create a new folder on github

"https/github.com/ericyu423/iOS11ClickAndDropExample" was enter initially

so it looks like I only need to input the file name.
